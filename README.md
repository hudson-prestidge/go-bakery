# go-bakery
Simple shopping cart web app built with go backend.

broad plan:
shopping cart for mini pies and other baked goods
using
  GO
  typescript
  sass
  templating(thinking pug)  
  mysql?
(lodash or underscore or similar?)
to show I can work with different technologies!

once this project is complete I'm going to build the portfolio site that houses this and the previous project(https://github.com/hudson-prestidge/note-taking-express)
