          <img src="" alt="" class="team-member-picture">
          <p class='team-member-description'>Ted Muffinsworth is a stalwart member of the Go Bakery crew. A veteran of the thirty year bread war, he suffers from severe ptsd triggered by the smell or sound of dough raising.</p>
          <p class='team-member-likes'>Likes: - Long walks on the beach<br>- The hissing sound left behind when the incessant buzzing of his humdrum life dies down to a dull murmur.</p>
          <p class='team-member-dislikes'>Dislikes: - When people use the words 'mouthfeel', or 'yeet'.</p>

          <img src="" alt="" class="team-member-picture">
          <p class='team-member-description'>Sharon is fourth in line to the Doughsbury throne, and that we employ her at all is a constant reminder that nepotism is alive and well in the baking industry as in life.</p>
          <p class='team-member-likes'>Likes: - Anthropomorphisation of seemingly unlikely things like toothache, or chutzpah.</p>
          <p class='team-member-dislikes'>Dislikes: - Showing up to work on time</br>- People that squeeze toothpaste tubes from the wrong end.</p>

          <p class='team-member-likes'>Likes: - Concise summaries.</p>
